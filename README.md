Gesture Volume Control Project


Overview


This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to enable volume control through hand gestures. Using Python, OpenCV, and the MediaPipe library, it tracks hand landmarks in real-time to adjust the system's volume level. Ideal for touchless interaction, this application enhances accessibility and provides a novel way to interact with your computer.


Features


Real-time hand gesture recognition.

Dynamic volume control based on gesture intensity.

Visual feedback for gesture detection and volume level.
