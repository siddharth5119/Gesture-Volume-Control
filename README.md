Gesture Volume Control Project
Overview
This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to enable volume control through hand gestures. Using Python, OpenCV, and the MediaPipe library, it tracks hand landmarks in real-time to adjust the system's volume level. Ideal for touchless interaction, this application enhances accessibility and provides a novel way to interact with your computer.

Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition.
Dynamic volume control based on gesture intensity.
Visual feedback for gesture detection and volume level.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer.
An Anaconda environment (recommended for package management and isolation).
Setting Up the Environment
Clone the repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/gesture-volume-control.git
Navigate to the cloned directory.
bash
Copy code
cd gesture-volume-control
If you're using Anaconda, create a new environment with the provided environment.yml file.
bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gesture-control
Alternatively, use pip to install the required packages.
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the application, ensure your environment is activated, then execute the main script.

css
Copy code
python main.py
Perform the gesture as indicated in the application's instructions to control the volume. The default gesture involves pinching and moving your thumb and index finger to adjust the volume level.
